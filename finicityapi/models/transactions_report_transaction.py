    The fields used in the Transactions Report Transactions record

    Attributes:
        id (long|int): The Finicity ID of the financial transaction.
        amount (float): The total amount of the transaction. Transactions for
            deposits are positive values, and withdrawals and debits are
            negative values.
        posted_date (long|int): A timestamp showing when the transaction was
            posted or cleared by the institution.
        description (string): The financial institution provides the
            description of the transaction (often known as the payee), but if
            itâ€™s left blank, then Finicity passes the value: No description
            provided by institution.
        normalized_payee (string): A normalized payee, derived from the
            transaction's description and memo fields.
        institution_transaction_id (string): The unique identifier given by
            the financial institution for each transaction.
        category (CategoriesEnum): A value from the Categories Enumerations,
            and assigned based on the payee name.
        memo (string): The memo field of the transaction, as provided by the
            institution. The institution must provide either a description, a
            memo, or both. It is recommended to concatenate the two fields
            into a single value
