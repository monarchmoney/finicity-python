        Client apps are not permitted to automate calls to the Refresh
        services. Active accounts are automatically refreshed by Finicity once

        once per day, calling Refresh repeatedly is usually a waste of

        specific business case for the need of data that is up to date as of
        the moment. Please discuss with your account manager and systems
        engineer for further clarification.

        order to receive a response. However you can terminate the connection
        after making the call the operation will still complete. You will have

        attempt date to know when the refresh is complete.

        """Does a POST request to /aggregation/v1/customers/{customerId}/accounts/{accountId}/transactions/historic.

        Connect to the accountâ€™s financial institution and load up to 24
        months of historic transactions for the account. Length of history
        varies by institution.
        This is a premium service. The billable event is a call to this
        service specifying a customerId that has not been seen before by this
        service. (If this service is called multiple times with the same
        customerId, to load transactions from multiple accounts, only one
        billable event has occurred.)
        HTTP status of 204 means historic transactions have been loaded
        successfully. The transactions are now available by calling Get
        Customer Account Transactions.
        HTTP status of 203 means the response contains an MFA challenge.
        Contact your Account Manager or Systems Engineers to determine the
        best route to handle this HTTP status code.
        The recommended timeout setting for this request is 180 seconds in
        order to receive a response. However you can terminate the connection
        after making the call the operation will still complete. You will have
        to pull the account records to check for an updated aggregation
        attempt date to know when the refresh is complete.
        This service usually requires the HTTP header Content-Length: 0
        because it is a POST request with no request body.
        The date range sent to the institution is calculated from the
        accountâ€™s createdDate. This means that calling this service a second
        time for the same account normally will not add any new transactions
        for the account. For this reason, a second call to this service for a
        known accountId will usually return immediately with HTTP 204.
        In a few specific scenarios, it may be desirable to force a second
        connection to the institution for a known accountId. Some examples
        are:
        - The institutionâ€™s policy has changed, making more transactions
        available.
        - Finicity has now added a longer transaction history support for the
        institution.
        - The first call encountered an error, and the resulting Aggregation
        Ticket has now been fixed by the Finicity Support Team.
        In these cases, the POST request can contain the parameter force=true
        in the request body to force the second connection.
